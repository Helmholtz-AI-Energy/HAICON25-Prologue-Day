# Title

# Description
<!--Provide a description of the tutorial you would like to host. Feel free to include any links to software you plan
on demonstrating or papers giving an overview of what you want to present-->

## Goals
<!--What objectives does the tutorial serve? Why is it important to include it as a part of HAICON 2025? -->

# Organizational
<!--In the following, please provide organizational information about the session. -->

## Host(s)
<!--Names and e-mail addresses of all people involved in hosting this session.-->

## Format
<!--A tutorial should be more than just a presentation - there should be an interactive element. Do you plan on including
this interactive element through programming tasks, discussions, collaborative tasks, or something different? -->

## Number of participants
<!-- Define the minimal number of participants you need for your tutorial to be a success. 
Is there a limit to the number of people who attend this session? -->

## Material
<!-- State here the material and devices you need: beamer/ projectors, flipchart, paper, markers, post-its, etc. 
We will then see what we can provide and let you know, if you should bring something yourself-->

## Pre-Requisites
<!-- State here the software tools and other privileges that are needed. For instance, prior knowledge, installation of software, access to HAICORE etc.  -->

## Preferred Slot *(Morning, Afternoon or No preference)*
<!--State the time slot which is your preference (we cannot guarentee that we will be able to fulfil your request, but
we will try our best).-->

## Want to host the tutorial session in both slots?
<!--Since the tutorials are run parallel to campus tours, you may be able to reach a wider audience if you offer your
tutorial in both slots. If you are interested in this, please state your interest here! -->

## What's next?
Thanks for creating this proposal! For now, you don't have to do anything else. Once we have received all the proposals and are developing the final prologue day program we will be in touch again to confirm any final details (time slot, room, material etc.). If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out [HAI Consultant Team - KIT](mailto:consultant-helmholtz.ai@kit.edu).
