**Welcome to the Tutorials and Unconference at the Helmholtz AI conference 2025, June 2nd, 2025, Karlsruhe ([Full program](https://events.hifis.net/event/2137/))!**
 
Find out when to create a space for peer-to-peer learning, collaboration, and creativity. Join us for dynamic unconference and tutorial sessions, where innovation knows no bounds. Grab this unique opportunity to engage, collaborate, and set the tone for an unforgettable conference experience.

Unconferences are participant-driven events where the attendees decide the topics and shape the agenda. Here, we believe in the collective power of bright minds coming together to spark innovation and inspire change. For more information on Unconferences check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ai3cl-fWvE) or [this](https://unconference.net/unconferencing-how-to-prepare-to-attend-an-unconference-2/). 

To value your urge to learn state-of-the-art technologies and collaborate with like-minded people, we are providing the opportunity to have two exciting slots of tutorial sessions, which will happen in parallel to a guided tour of the campus. 

This repository is used for topic collection.


## 🌟 Why Attend?

- **No Pre-set Agenda**: We go with the flow rather than following a rigid schedule. Topics are proposed and selected by participants!
- **Diverse Voices**: Everyone has a voice. Share your passion, engage in dynamic discussions, and learn from peers.
- **Networking**: Connect with like-minded individuals. The next big idea might be a conversation away!

## 🌟 What do you need?

- **A topic** - This would help to gather the right participants with similar interests.
- **A space** - ideally the venue with open space (which we will provide).
- **A facilitator** - who explains how the unconference works and crowdsources the agenda.

## 💡 Call for Contributions!

We believe everyone has something valuable to share. If you're passionate about a topic, we encourage you to propose a session! You want to learn about something from others? You want feedback on your project or ideas? You want to get some coding done with the help of others? This is your chance!

## Tips

📜 Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the idea.

📜 Use the issue template to put your abstract in the right shape - we need information such as a session title, description, responsible persons, timeframe and so on.

📜 Please make sure that your session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible. 💁

🗣️ At the beginning of the unconference we will have an introduction session where all session organizers will have the chance to pitch their project idea and to guide people to their session. Prepare yourself for a <1 min pitch.

👍 Please vote on project ideas/issues that you consider interesting.

📜 Please add a short summary about the outcome of your session to the open git issue, e.g., specify specific results, link to documents you worked on, specify goals for future collaboration you agreed on.
